# Interaction-Tree
>A library for reasoning about recursive and impure programs in Agda.

## Overview
Interaction Trees(ITree) are a coinductive data structure for representing recursive and impure programs. The theory is based of the paper [Interaction Trees: Representing Recursive and Impure Programs in Coq](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~stevez/papers/XZHH+20.pdf). The objective of this project is to offer an alternative implementation of the data structure in Agda.
## Warning
The project is currently under active development, and many of the features discussed in the paper have not yet been fully implemented.
